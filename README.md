Stacked Denoising Autoencoder
=============================

Introduction
------------
This is a C++11 implementation of stacked denoising autoencoder. 
In order to illustrate the model itself clearly, 
further optimizations are omitted.

Demo
----

  `$ make sdA_test.o`

  Compile test passed on Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS, g++ 4.8.4.

  Further experiments can be done to compare its performance
  with multi-layer perceptron.
